# GitLab Scrum Scaled Demo

This project demonstrates how GitLab’s built-in Scrum tools and group/project inheritance model can support agile coordination across multiple teams and systems — useful for large-scale, multi-organization initiatives.

## 🔍 Objective

To simulate how a national-scale program (e.g., involving partner agencies or distributed dev teams) can coordinate software delivery using:

- Shared iteration cadences
- Scoped labels
- Cross-project epic and story planning
- Group-inherited agile boards

## 📁 Repository Structure (to be expanded)

- `/docs/`: Explanations and walk-throughs of setup (in progress)
- `/demo-group-structure/`: Example screenshots or diagrams (planned)
- `.gitlab-ci.yml`: Placeholder for future integration ideas (optional)

## 📌 Why This Matters

Programs spanning multiple systems or teams (e.g., federated analytics platforms) often struggle with alignment. GitLab’s hierarchical structure enables:

- Standardization without stifling team autonomy
- Clear sprint cadences and backlogs across orgs
- Secure, traceable work breakdown from features to tasks

## 🚀 GitLab Concepts Covered

- Group vs. Project configuration
- Scoped labels (`status::`, `type::`, `priority::`)
- Epic → Issue → Task hierarchy
- Iteration cadences (2-week sprints)
- Issue boards and Release Planning
